# README

I'm imagining something more interesting with this thing. What if...

* Pokemon perspective game where you can wander around
* Big, big map of Salt Lake City
* A bunch of vignettes that you can follow around and (maybe!) interact with
* You're told to go find someone who literally does not exist. You can't find them; they're not there.

I think it would be a great encapsulation of our class on Modernism. Here's how we need to do it:
