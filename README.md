# README

I'm imagining something more interesting with this thing. What if...

* Pokemon perspective game where you can wander around
* Big, big map of Salt Lake City
* A bunch of vignettes that you can follow around and (maybe!) interact with
* You're told to go find someone who literally does not exist. You can't find them; they're not there.

I think it would be a great encapsulation of our class on Modernism. Here's how we need to do it:

## MANDATORY

- [ ] Movement happens with the pointer too
- [ ] The timer
	- [ ] There is a timer that shows how many minutes and seconds you have left to play
	- [ ] The timer counts down to zero
	- [ ] At zero, the game shuts down, showing the end screen
- [x] Music plays two seconds into the game scene
- [ ] The game abruptly ends after two minutes
- [ ] You may only play the game once per day

## NICE TO HAVE

- [ ] Create a whole bunch of vignettes
	- [x] Some sprite of me is in the game and dumps his whole life story on you, forcing you in a dialog space that is both very boring and very annoying
	- [ ] A pantsless schizophrenic who yells obscenities and gets stopped by the police
	- [ ] A man fresh out of prison asking for money
	- [ ] A car hits a pedestrian or cyclist
	- [ ] A conversation in French about the limitations of computing
	- [ ] There is a dog that will follow you once you interact with it
- [ ] Create a way to watch something play out
	- [ ] Create a scene that appears when pressing spacebar over interactable sprite
	- [ ] Have animation sequence that repeats for when you meander over
	- [ ] Trigger ability to leave it by hitting spacebar
- [ ] Create a whole bunch of interactable events
	- [ ] Typing in the konami code causes you to fall to the bottom of the screen and allows you to fly, irrespective of location
	- [ ] An iframe of _La Mort Voit_
	- [ ] The song "Dead" by They Might Be Giants
	- [ ] Gertrude Stein's portrait of Picasso, "If I Told Him"
	- [ ] A moving cubist portrait
	- [ ] Rite of Spring! Just sequences of the Rite of Spring!
	- [ ] There is a windowed scene of a bunch of cards that you can move around. Moving them into the order 1337 unlocks a door somewhere
	- [ ] Somewhere, somehow, the player can trigger [the sound byte of "The Animation Show" where the guy says "IT'S LIKE I CAN TOUCH YOU!!!!"](https://youtu.be/pMQ-t3nGzrI?t=317)
- [ ] All the player sprites
	- [ ] There are three women sprites
	- [ ] There are three men sprites
- [ ] Fully online and interactive
- [ ] Particles on opening scene

### Polish

- [ ] Get player sprites to appear behind foreground tiles
