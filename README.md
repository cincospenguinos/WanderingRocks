I'm imagining something more interesting with this thing. What if...

* Pokemon perspective game where you can wander around
* Big, big map of Salt Lake City
* A bunch of vignettes that you can follow around and (maybe!) interact with
* You're told to go find someone who literally does not exist. You can't find them; they're not there.

I think it would be a great encapsulation of our class on Modernism. Here's how we need to do it:

## TODO

- [x] Get a simple sprite to move on an empty screen
- [x] Movement is "cell-like," like in Pokemon
- [x] Create a simple map of Salt Lake City
- [x] Get the sprite to move in Salt Lake City
- [ ] Create a little dialogue system
	- [ ] Dialogue tileset view exists
	- [ ] On overlap of dialogue sprite dialogue menu appears
	- [ ] On spacebar with dialogue view shown dialogue menu starts up
	- [ ] Text of dialogue is displayed with a decent font
- [ ] Get walking animations to work for peoples
- [ ] Create a whole bunch of vignettes
	- [ ] Some sprite of me is in the game and dumps his whole life story on you, forcing you in a dialog space that is both very boring and very annoying
	- [ ] A pantsless schizophrenic who yells obscenities and gets stopped by the police
	- [ ] A man fresh out of prison asking for money
	- [ ] A car hits a pedestrian or cyclist
	- [ ] A conversation in French about the limitations of computing
	- [ ] There is a dog that will follow you once you interact with it
- [ ] Create a way to watch something play out
	- [ ] Create a scene that appears when pressing spacebar over interactable sprite
	- [ ] Have animation sequence that repeats for when you meander over
	- [ ] Trigger ability to leave it by hitting spacebar
- [ ] Create a whole bunch of watchable events
	- [ ] A moving cubist portrait
	- [ ] Rite of Spring! Just sequences of the Rite of Spring!
	- [ ] Gertrude Stein's portrait of Picasso, "If I Told Him"
- [ ] Create a waiting room that shows a randomly generated shape out of a subset of the tilemap (I'm thinking 3x3)
- [ ] Once the waiting room's timer hits zero, everybody in the waiting room appears on the map in random places
- [ ] There are a bunch of different player sprites
- [ ] Players are randomly assigned a sprite
- [ ] Movement checks in with the server before permitting movement
- [ ] You may only play the game once per day

### Polish

- [ ] Get player sprites to appear behind foreground tiles
